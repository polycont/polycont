Hi there, I'm Cohen Coberly.

I'm an aspiring full stack web developer and a game designer! 

I'm studying the former through The Odin Project, and I'm studying the latter at Full Sail University.

I love video games -- PC games, in particular -- and I love learning new skills, so this is pretty much the ideal state for me to be in.

I wish my fellow TOP participants the best of luck, and to anyone else that might read this, thanks for stopping by.
